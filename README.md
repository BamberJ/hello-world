# hello-world
Initial training session in Github, creating this Repo followed by a Branch and then making a commit. Finally opening and merging pull requests
This element is making the first "commit" in the readme-edit branch off of Master. Once Ive typed this it will be added to the file in the readme-edit branch file using the "commit changes" button at the bottom of the page, but not into the master branch file yet. This is how we effectively work on a mirrored branch of info until we are happy to merge into the master branch.
